FAQ:

Q1: What should I expect from the tex file used for the performaced test?

A1: You should assume it's a standalone tex file (see pdf). Also, it compiles, and it is typeset in English.


Q2: Can we submit any files other than just encoder and decoder (e.g. a dictionary used in encoding)?

A2: Yes


Q3: are we allowed to adapt code found elsewhere, e.g. stackoverflow?

A3: Yes, but you must properly cite that code. Also, note that adapting existing code may not give high marks for the report.


Q4: can we include more than 6 ideas in the implementation, provided we only explain 6 in the report?

A4: Yes


Q5: when you say the report must be typed in latex, are you expecting it to be submitted as a .tex file or a .pdf?

A5: pdf


Q6: So if I've just described an idea I've adapted, I would get 0 marks for it, whereas if it was completely novel I would get 5 marks? (provided that the performance is reasonable)

A6: It's not so clear cut. An idea that should perform well but is already implemented (e.g. "I am using deflate") is not likely to give you full marks, but I would almost surely award yuo some marks for it. Especially if you can justify why that idea is appropriate for the setting of the coursework. Likewise, if you have a very unexpected idea but you cannot convince me that it makes sense/is appropriate, then you are not going to get full marks.


Q7: What exactly do you mean by 'original'? Are we not just implementing existing compression methods?

A7: Again, that is difficult to define. I expect that some of your ideas will be taken from the course, but others will be your own. I value ideas that come from other modules (past or current) or from compression methods that we haven't seen in the course. But it's very difficult to properly assess the originality/appropriateness of an idea.


Q8: are there any limits on the libraries we can use?

A8: If pip can install it, then it should be fine. Otherwise, I may have to contact you.


Q9: on the library limit point, I'm assuming if I get a python library that performs zip and just use that, that's probably bad right?

A9: See A6. It's not good for the report indeed. I'm confident that a lot of student will beat the compression ratio of zip, so it would be bad for the performance part too!


Q10: in terms of originality, how many marks does an idea from class get?

A10: See A7.


Q11: Also, is there any limit on the running time?

A11: No, but in any case the test file is only ca. 1MB in size, so even a slow encoder shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. This being said, if your code is extremely slow and it looks like it's stuck, then I might contact you. 


Q12: should the code be commented?

A12: I am not requiring that your code should be commented. But you should do it, it's good practice!


Q13: How is the attack plan marked? i.e. if it is a successful attack plan, does it receive 20 marks? Is it marked for how novel it is?

A13: The marking scheme for the attack plan is difficult to pinpoint. If your attack is successful, then you will most probably get a high mark but I expect some explanation and analysis. On the other hand, yuo needn't carry out the attack to get a high mark on the attack plan.


Q14: What's the due date?

A14: 21/01/2021


Q15: Just to check are we expected to be coming up with an implementation, as in if we just use a existing password cracking software would that not be correct?

A15: You are expected to come up with an implementation.
